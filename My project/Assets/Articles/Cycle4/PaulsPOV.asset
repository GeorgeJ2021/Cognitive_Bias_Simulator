  headline: "Paul E. Teshun Rejects \n\u201CSuper Concrete\u201D"
  body: "Mayoral candidate Paul E. Teshun dismissed the Mad Scientist\u2019s super
    concrete, a type of concrete that screams before collapsing, as \u201Ca gimmick\u201D
    that distracts from the real issue: long-term safety.\n\nIn response, Teshun
    argued, \u201CThis city doesn\u2019t need last-minute warnings. It needs infrastructure
    that never reaches that point.\u201D \n\nTeshun outlined a detailed plan for
    preventive maintenance, inspections, and material upgrades with some involving
    partnerships with FabriKator, to address aging structures responsibly."
