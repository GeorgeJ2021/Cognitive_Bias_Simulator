  headline: "Mad Scientist Proposes \n\u201CSuper Concrete\u201D"
  body: "In the heated public debate over infrastructure safety, the local Mad Scientist
    stunned viewers by proposing a new material ,called \"super concrete\", that
    emits a loud, Dinosaur-like scream moments before collapse.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    simple,\u201D he explained, arms flailing. \u201CIf it screams, you run.\"\n\nWhen
    Teshun pressed about feasibility, costs, or testing, the Mad Scientist waved
    off concerns, calling Paul E. Teshun\u2019s alternatives as \u201CNeolithic thinking\u201D."
