  headline: "More Voices Emerge \nin FabriKator Scandal"
  body: "In the wake of recent scrutiny, multiple new whistleblowers have come forward
    with claims against FabriKator and its former CEO, Fabio Katel.\n\n\u201CThere
    were red flags for years,\u201D said one former logistics officer. \u201CBut
    when I read that article about the firestation upgrade being approved before
    the paperwork, something clicked. I realized I wasn\u2019t the only one who saw
    it.\u201D\n\nWith Mayor Jeff now in office, some believe the sudden wave of testimony
    signals a shift in confidence, however vague his leadership may seem."
