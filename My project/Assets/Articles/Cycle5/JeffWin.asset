  headline: "JEFF DECLARED \nNEW MAYOR !\r\n"
  body: "In a result no one saw coming, but everyone now claims to have expected,
    independent candidate Jeff has been elected mayor.\n\n\u201CI always liked Jeff,\u201D
    said one voter. \u201CHe just\u2026 felt right, you know?\u201D.\n\nDespite receiving
    little to no media attention during the campaign, Jeff\u2019s quiet consistency
    seems to have won the day. In his acceptance speech, Jeff stood silently at the
    podium for several moments before saying, \u201CThank you.\u201D The crowd erupted
    in applause."
