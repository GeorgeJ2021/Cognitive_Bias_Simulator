  headline: "Quiet Testimony \nTopples Katel"
  body: "Though there were no headlines at the time, a FabriKator employee quietly
    gave authorities internal documents that became key evidence in the fraud case
    against CEO Fabio Katel.\n\nSources say the whistleblower nearly went public
    but chose to work behind the scenes. Their identity remains protected, but prosecutors
    called the testimony \u201Cessential\u201D to the conviction.\n\n\u201CThey believed
    the truth would catch up, with or without media attention,\u201D one official
    said. \u201CThey were right.\u201D"
