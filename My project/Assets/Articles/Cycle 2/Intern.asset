    has finally broken their silence.\n\n\u201CI didn\u2019t even know I had cancer
    until that day, then the next thing I know, I\u2019m cured\u2026 but now I keep
    craving raw meat and  my pupils do this slitted thing in bright light now. But
    yeah, overall? Feeling good.\u201D \n\nDespite the weird side effects, he says
    he\u2019s just happy to be cancer-free and still plans to stick around for the
