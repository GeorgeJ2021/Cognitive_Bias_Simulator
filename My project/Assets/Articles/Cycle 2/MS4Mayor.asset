  body: "In a bizzare turn of events The Mad Scientist has officially entered the
    mayoral race.\n\nBacked by the fringe, Progressive Freedom Forward party, the
    Mad Scientist was recruited to remove red tape strangling science in this town.\nAt
    a press event, the Mad Scientist shouted:\n\u201CI SHALL COMPLETE THE REPTILE
    GENOME WHEEL!\u201D\n\nWhen a reporter asked what he could offer society beyond
    his own experiments, he paused and muttered: \u201CFine. Maybe I can do some
    Civic stuff, too.\u201D"
