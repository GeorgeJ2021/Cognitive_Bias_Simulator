  headline: 'Collapsed Overpass Sparks

    Infrastructure Concerns'
  body: "Chaos unfolded yesterday afternoon when a section of the old overpass gave
    way during light traffic. Emergency services confirmed three fatalities and two
    others hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nEyewitnesses described hearing
    a loud crack followed by screams. City engineers have begun inspecting nearby
    structures, but residents are voicing frustration over long-standing neglect
    of aging infrastructure. \n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve complained about this overpass
    for years,\u201D said a local business owner. \u201CNow it\u2019s too late.\u201D"
