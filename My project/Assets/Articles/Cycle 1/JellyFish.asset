  headline: 'New Species of Jelly Fish Found '
  body: "Marine biologists have identified a new species of jellyfish, nicknamed
    \"Glow Gust\", describing it as \"translucent, slow-moving, and faintly bioluminescent.\"\nThe
    creature measures just 4 cm across and emits a soft blue glow when disturbed.
    Experts say it poses no threat to humans and is likely a deep-sea drifter brought
    closer to shore by shifting currents. \nThis discovery has sparked some excitement
    among biologists and exactly one themed beachside cocktail."
