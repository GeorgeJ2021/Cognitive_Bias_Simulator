  headline: "PRESIDENT DECLARES \nWAR (on peppers)"
  body: "In a move no one saw coming, the President of Genericstan has officially
    banned capsicum nationwide.\n\n\"Frankly, I just don't trust a vegetable that
    can be green, yellow, or red without warning,\" the President said during a press
    conference held beside a color-coded vegetable chart. \n\nFarmers have shrugged,
    and supermarkets have quietly replaced capsicum. No protests have been reported,
    though one man in East Genericstan reportedly sighed and said, \u201COkay, sure,
    I guess.\u201D"
