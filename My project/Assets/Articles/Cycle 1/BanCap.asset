  headline: "President of Genericstan \nBans Capsicum"
  body: "\"Frankly, I just don't trust a vegetable that can be green, yellow, or
    red without warning,\" the President said during a press conference held beside
    a color-coded vegetable chart. \u201CPick a lane.\u201D\nFarmers have shrugged,
    and supermarkets have quietly replaced capsicum. \n\nNo protests have been reported,
    though one man in East Genericstan reportedly sighed and said, \u201COkay, sure,
    I guess.\u201D"
