  headline: "Belief in Upward \nMobility Drops"
  body: "A new report from the City Research Bureau shows a steep decline in public
    belief that hard work leads to a better life. Over 60% of residents surveyed
    said they feel \"locked in place\" economically or socially.\n\n\u201CYou grind,
    save, follow the rules\u2026 and you\u2019re still one bad week away from disaster,\u201D
    said one warehouse worker.\n\nSociologists warn this growing cynicism may lead
    to reduced civic participation, disengagement from the workforce, and a rise
    in survivalist attitudes."
