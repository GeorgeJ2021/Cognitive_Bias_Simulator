  body: "Since the election, Jeff has held a few brief press appearances, mostly
    nodding and smiling. City Hall reports that he's been reviewing things and that
    \u201CJeff has a plan.\u201D\n\nWhen asked about the city\u2019s biggest issues,
    like the collapsed overpass, Jeff simply replied, \u201CYes,\u201D and later,
    \u201COk\u201D which left reporters puzzled but strangely satisfied.\n\n\u201CHe
    seems calm,\u201D said an official. \u201CHonestly, that\u2019s enough right
    now.\u201D"
