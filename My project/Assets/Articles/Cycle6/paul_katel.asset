  headline: "Questions Linger \nOver Paul-Katel Ties"
  body: "A recent investigation has raised concerns over potential backdoor dealings
    between newly elected Mayor Paul E. Teshun and FabriKator CEO Fabio Katel.\n\nIndependent
    journalist Marla Norr uncovered a trail of emails, meeting records, and private
    donations that suggest a close relationship during the campaign. While none of
    the findings are illegal, they\u2019ve prompted questions about transparency
    and influence.\n\n\u201CEverything points to a quiet understanding,\u201D Norr
    said. \u201CBut nothing that would hold up in court.\u201D"
