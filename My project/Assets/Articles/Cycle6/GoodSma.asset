  headline: "Fleece Market Draws \nRecord Crowds"
  body: "The city\u2019s first-ever Fleece Market drew big crowds this weekend, with
    booths full of handmade scarves, sweaters, and cozy treats.\n\nOrganized by local
    volunteers, the event mixed crafts, cider, and good vibes while raising money
    for the overpass relief efforts along the way.\n\n\u201CThis should happen every
    year,\u201D one visitor said. \u201CIt\u2019s like the whole town got together.\u201D
    Turns out, all it took to bring the community together was a little warmth and
    a lot of yarn."
