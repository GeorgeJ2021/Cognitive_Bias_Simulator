  headline: "Mad Scientist \nDenies Loss"
  body: "Following Paul E. Teshun\u2019s election victory, the Mad Scientist was
    seen being forcibly removed from city hall after attempting to climb onto the
    podium while shouting, \u201CTHIS ISN'T OVER!\u201D\n\nWhen later asked how he
    handled the defeat, he answered: \u201COh, I am entirely composed and collected
    now.\u201D He then added, eyes twitching, \u201CBut the election was RIGGED!
    THE NUMBERS ARE WRONG! I HAD IT ALL PLANNED OUT!\u201D\n\nPaul E. Teshun has
    reportedly increased his personal security, just in case."
