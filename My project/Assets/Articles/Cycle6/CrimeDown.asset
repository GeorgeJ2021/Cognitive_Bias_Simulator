    in Petty Crime'
  body: "After a shaky start to the year, police say rates of theft and vandalism
    are beginning to fall across the city.\n\n\u201CThanks to community cooperation
    and targeted patrols, we\u2019re seeing improvements,\u201D said Officer Lee.
    \u201CIt\u2019s not perfect, but the trend is encouraging.\u201D\n\nResidents
    credit better lighting, local watch groups, and new youth programs for the shift.
    While some remain cautious, many agree: the city feels just a little safer this
    month."
