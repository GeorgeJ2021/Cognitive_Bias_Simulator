  headline: "Super Concrete \nWorks... Sort of"
  body: "The new overpass built with the Mad Scientist\u2019s \u201Csuper concrete\u201D
    let out a terrifying, dinosaur-like scream just before partially collapsing.
    No one was hurt, thanks to the warning. \n\nBut the material was supposed to
    prevent collapse altogether. Some of the Mad Scientist's supporters admit they
    were just hoping he\u2019d fail upward again. \n\nThis time, he did exactly what
    he promised and that's what worries people. Headphones are recommended since
    the overpass still growls periodically. "
