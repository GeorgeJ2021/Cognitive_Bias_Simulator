  headline: "Petty Crime Getting \nOut of Control?"
  body: "Petty thefts, break-ins, and public disturbances continue to rise, with
    some neighborhoods reporting a 25% increase in just the last month.\n\n\u201CWe
    lock up, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter anymore,\u201D said one store owner.
    \u201CPeople are nervous. You can feel it.\u201D \n\nPolice cite economic stress
    and underreporting as compounding factors, but many residents say they\u2019ve
    stopped expecting help altogether. With no clear plan in sight, public trust
    is slipping and fear is filling the gap."
