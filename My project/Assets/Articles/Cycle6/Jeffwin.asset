  headline: "Candidates Reflect \non Jeff\u2019s Win"
  body: "In the aftermath of Jeff\u2019s mayoral victory, defeated candidates Mad
    Scientist and Paul E. Teshun had surprisingly calm reactions.\n\n\u201CYeah,
    that makes sense,\u201D Paul shrugged when asked about the outcome. The Mad Scientist
    simply sighed. \n\n\u201CBack to the status quo, I suppose,\u201D he said, adjusting
    his goggles. \n\nAs for Jeff, he\u2019s reportedly taking meetings, though no
    one\u2019s entirely sure where."
