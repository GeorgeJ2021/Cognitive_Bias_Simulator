  headline: 'FabriKator faces

    Scrutiny or Sabotage?'
  body: "As FabriKator faces allegations of contract irregularities, some officials
    are questioning the timing and intent behind the controversy.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019ve
    delivered on firestation upgrades and clean infrastructure ahead of schedule,\u201D
    said the Deputy Public Works. \u201CNow, right before the election, suddenly
    they\u2019re the problem?\u201D\n\nSome point to the rising popularity of the
    Mad Scientist, whose flashy inventions outshine FabriKator. \u201CIt\u2019s odd,\u201D
    said one staffer. \u201CAn unsupervised inventor outpaces a national firm, then
    that firm\u2019s under fire?\u201D"
