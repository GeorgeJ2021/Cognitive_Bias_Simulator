  headline: 'FabriKator faces

    Scrutiny or Sabotage?'
  body: "As FabriKator faces allegations of contract irregularities, some officials
    are questioning the timing and intent behind the controversy.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019ve
    delivered on infrastructure upgrades ahead of schedule,\u201D said the Deputy
    Public Works. \u201CNow, right before the election, suddenly they\u2019re the
    problem?\u201D\n\nSome suspect the Mad Scientist\u2019s rise in popularity. \"Isn't
    it odd that an unsupervised inventor outshines a national firm while that firm's
    under fire?\" one staffer remarked."
