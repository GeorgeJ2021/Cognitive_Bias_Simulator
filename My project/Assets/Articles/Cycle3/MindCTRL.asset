  headline: "Mad Scientist invents Mind \nControl, Cures Dementia"
  body: "Originally designed to control voters, the Mad Scientist's device instead
    sparked a miraculous recovery in an elderly test subject, who now recalls long-lost
    memories with astonishing clarity.\n\n\u201CI picked him because older minds
    are usually easier to influence.\" the Scientist explained calmly, before shouting:
    \u201CHOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THIS STUPID THING WOULD CURE DEMENTIA? NOW THIS
    GUY WON\u2019T SHUT UP!\u201D\n\nWhile ethical questions remain, the man\u2019s
    family says they\u2019re grateful to the Scientist."
