  headline: "Programmer Says AI \nCan Run the City"
  body: "In a viral forum post, teen programmer \u201Cn00Byte17\u201D claimed he
    built an AI that could \u201Cdo the job of the entire city council faster, cheaper,
    and with fewer snack breaks.\u201D\n\nWhile intended as a joke, the post sparked
    debate online, with some users asking if a \u201Crobo-council\u201D might actually
    improve efficiency.\nCity officials called the claim \u201Claughable,\u201D but
    declined to comment on current snack policies."
